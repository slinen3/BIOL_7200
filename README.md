Code from BIOL 7200 (Programming Bioinformatics) Assignments


## Assignments Overview

1. **amplicon_align.py**
   - Description: Performs in-silico Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on two assembly files, align the resulting amplicons, and output the aligned sequences along with the alignment score. This Python script utilizes the magnumopus library for isPCR and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for sequence alignment.

2. **ex10_functions.py**
   - Description: Performs Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis and subsequent amplicon identification based on the results. This Python script consists of several functions to streamline the BLAST process and filter the results for specific criteria.

3. **identify_homologs.sh**
   - Description: Identifies genes containing homologous histidine kinase domains within a given BED file.

4. **ispcr.py**
   - Description: Python script for in-silico PCR (polymerase chain reaction), facilitates the identification of amplicons from a given primer file and assembly file.

5. **__init__.py**
   - Description: Initialization file for ispcr package.

6. **match_sequences.py**
   - Description: Performs a simple pairwise sequence alignment check.

7. **needleman_wunsch.py**
   - Description: Performs pairwise sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
  
8. **q1.py**
   - Description: Imports step_one function from the ispcr module and uses it to obtain sorted BLAST hits.
  
9. **q2.py**
   - Description: Imports step_two function from the ispcr module and uses it to identify paired hits based on a specified maximum amplicon size
     
10. **q3.py**
   - Description: Imports  step_three function from the ispcr moduleand uses step_three to obtain amplicons based on provided hit pairs and assembly fil.e

11. **slinen3.py** a
    - Description: Plotting pactice script using COVID-19 hospitalization rate data.

12. **slinen3_1-3.py**
    - Description: Python practice. Function generate_triangle creates a triangle pattern using a specified character.
      
13. **slinen3_2-3.py**
   - Description: Python practice. Function check_parentheses if a string of parentheses is properly paired.
     
14. **slinen3_3-3.py**
    - Description: Finds homologous genes based on a BLAST analysis, genomic feature information, and assembly sequences.
    
15. **slinen3_EC.py**
   - Description: Filters and identifies homologous genes based on BLAST analysis in BED format.
